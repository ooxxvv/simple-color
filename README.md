Cursor theme, just simple & colorful

### Simple & Colorful

There are many definition of cursor on X11 cursor theme, but that is too completate for me.

I realize that only few cursors are used in almost of time when I working on computer in these years.
So, I create this theme to collection a lot of definitions into few cursors.

There are only few cursor in this theme, but they link to all definition of cursor theme:
 * a-pointer: Normal Pointer
 * click-able: Any click-able elements (link, button...)
 * input-text: Elements of text typing (text, hand-write, termaial...)
 * move-able: Elements that can be drag and move
 * sizer: Elements that can be re-size (corner, tee...)
 * forbidden: Forbidden, Error & Danger
 * zoom-able: Zoom, Zoom-in & Zoom-out
 * something-else: Other cursors of theme but I don't really know when they will show
