Cursor theme, just simple & colorful

=== Simple & Colorful ===
There are many definition of cursor on X11 cursor theme, but that is too completate for me.

I realize that only few cursors are used in almost of time when I working on computer in these years.
So, I create this theme to collection a lot of definitions into few cursors.

There are only few cursor in this theme, but they link to all definition of cursor theme:
 * a-pointer: Normal Pointer
 * click-able: Any click-able elements (link, button...)
 * forbidden: Forbidden, error or danger
 * hand-writer: Acutaly, I don't reamber what is the last time I saw this cursor on my screen
 * input-text: For input field (text, termaial...)
 * move-able: For some element that can be drag (window, icon...)
 * selector: Again, I don't reamber what is the last time I saw this cursor on my screen
 * sizer: For any sizer (window, tee...)
 * zoom-able: Zoom, Zoom-in & Zoom-out
 * something-else: There are some cursor in theme but I don't really know when they will show
